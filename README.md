# Numerist_July_23_Data_Challenge
# Cleaning and Analyzing Data in Excel
# Introduction
This project is a data analysis challenge organized by Chloe Morgan. The dataset was provided on twitter about the product launch for SocialBlaze's new app, Ribbon. There is also another app called InstantSnaps- Users accounts on InstanSnaps linked to Ribbon. The dataset contained 31 days track period and 13 columns which include; Date, Total Ribbon app Installs, Total Ribbon User Sign Ups, Daily Active Users on InstantSnaps and others.
# Data Manipulation and Preprocessing
After importing the data into my excel sheet, i took several manipulations and steps to calculate various metrics in determining the success of the apps with the data provided. I measured the percentage of users activation rate by dividing the total installs by user sign ups. The user engagement metrics was also measured by getting the average users in the track period using the daily active users column for both apps. I also tracked the events in the app, that is, how users are engaging and using the app and also the average time spent on the app per user. Crash and uninstall rate for each day was calculated and the columns was provided. In addition, i grouped the date column into weekly basis for improved efficiency and quality of data.
# Data Analysis and Visualizations 
a.   What are the percentages of users who launch the Ribbon app for use?

   ![N1](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/df616509-078c-49ab-afdf-13d723f367ff) 

When the Ribbon App first launched, fewer users installed and used it than expected. The second day and beyond saw a sharp increase in the number of people who installed and registered     for the app. It can be inferred that users initially weren't familiar with the app and how it functions to gain their interest, and once the interest was established, a large number of     users who downloaded the app always sign up and use the app. This pattern persisted throughout the app track time.
   
b.   How many users are active on the app?

   ![N2](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/6a0ec539-0cf8-4743-9e48-380b5cf35f4f) 

The data made available demonstrated the Ribbon app's track time for a period of 31 days, which was then divided into 7 days to create a week and offered 5 weeks of track period. At the end of each week, the Ribbon app's daily active users are displayed in the graph above. The app had 40,000 users when it first launched, but by the end of the week, that number had significantly climbed to millions of people. Even though there were little declines during the track period, the biggest loss was 9% at the conclusion of the third week. As a result, it may be inferred that the app's active user base increased with time.

   ![N3](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/acbb6687-2043-4405-8769-285f6a34c0a0) 

The largest audience for the app appeared in week 4 after a 1% increase from the prior week. Due to the fact that there are three days in a week, it is not surprising that there were less users during week 5. However, since it was released, the app has had an average weekly user growth of 32%.

   ![N4](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/7d5499a7-6d5f-486b-8b3f-099f3bc6148e) 

At its first debut, InstantSnaps had accumulated billions of users who actively used it. Although there have been ups and downs in user numbers since the launch of the service, it began adding roughly 6% of active users every day by day 15 and kept up that trend until the end of the evaluation period.

c.   How well are these active users making use of the app?

   ![N5](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/b69ad1ac-0e59-42a0-85ce-4d3a5442e6ea) 

Interest and social norms, for example, can have an impact on the amount of time spent using social media apps. The Ribbon app has an average of 85 million users daily and data show that users spend an average of 318 minutes on the app. People spend an average of 5 hours and 58 minutes using the app at its launch and 24 hours later it dropped to 3 hours and 47 minutes. It saw a significant increase by day 11 (483 minutes), day 20 (485 minutes) which then hit its highest at day 29 (510 minutes) and settled at 287 minutes by day 31. This shows that even though the time lengths are slightly reduced, once users sign in to Ribbon app, they consistently use it for a substantial amount of time.

   ![N6](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/6345f1e8-1511-4754-9cce-5888999cd197)

A total of 65,288,000 posts were made by users throughout the course of the 31-day track, or nearly 2,000,000 posts each day. Users view 76% of these posts, and data suggest that 60% of these users who are active would like a given post, resulting in an average of 51 million likes every day. A total of 774,226,356 posts were being reposted, which indicates 29% of users are likely to do so. Since the introduction of the Ribbon app, there has been a considerable decline in the amount of reposted posts. After that, week 4 saw a peak of 35% active users reposting.

d.   What is the crash rate on the Ribbon app and its significant effect on users?

   ![N7](https://github.com/OlotoDamilola/Numerist_July_Data_Challenge/assets/109422215/13d440ef-6c74-4bbd-a71a-0d5e1a79a558) 

Users of the Ribbon app report a high crash rate of 74% at debut indicating that more testing and improvement are needed. About 5% users left the app and uninstalled it over the first few days as a result of the frequent crashes which also impacted the user experience. Moving on, it was seen that the app was quite reliable with crash rates dropping to 1% for 48 hours until reaching zero. Of course, this increases the app's convenience for users as seen by the fact that users who install the app always sign up and consistently use the app and absolutely reduce user uninstalling the app.

# Recommendation
a. Because the repost rate is below average, Ribbon app features could be improved
b. Pay attention to Monthly Active User (MAU) for further analysis 

# Question from CEO 
a. How can we leverage the success of the app launch to further enhance our products and services?
   Giving consumers access to in-app assistance features will improve user interaction with the app. In order to measure the level of        customer satisfaction, it is encouraged to request feedback.

b. Are there any opportunities for expansion or improvements in user acquisition?
   Yes, reaching a wide audience through running campaigns on other apps to recruit new users. This should require a strategic plan to       measure and manage these campaigns in order to identify the ones that are working well.
