# Cleaning and Analyzing Data in Excel
# Introduction
This project is a data analysis challenge organized by Chloe Morgan. The dataset was provided on twitter about the product launch for SocialBlaze's new app, Ribbon. There is also another app called InstantSnaps- Users accounts on InstanSnaps linked to Ribbon. The dataset contained 31 days track period and 13 columns which include; Date, Total Ribbon app Installs, Total Ribbon User Sign Ups, Daily Active Users on InstantSnaps and others.
# Data Manipulation and Preprocessing
After importing the data into my excel sheet, i took several manipulations and steps to calculate various metrics in determining the success of the apps with the data provided. I measured the percentage of users activation rate by dividing the total installs by user sign ups. The user engagement metrics was also measured by getting the average users in the track period using the daily active users column for both apps. I also tracked the events in the app, that is, how users are engaging and using the app and also the average time spent on the app per user. Crash and uninstall rate for each day was calculated and the columns was provided. In addition, i grouped the date column into weekly basis for improved efficiency and quality of data.
# Data Analysis and Visualizations 
1. What are the percentages of users who launch the Ribbon app for use?

   When the Ribbon App first launched, fewer users installed and used it than expected. The second day and beyond saw a sharp increase in the number of people who installed and registered     for the app. It can be inferred that users initially weren't familiar with the app and how it functions to gain their interest, and once the interest was established, a large number of     users who downloaded the app always sign up and use the app. This pattern persisted throughout the app track time.
